# Python / Event server

## Description

Server with HTTP API to manage events and consumer offsets

## API

### Receiving an event for a specific stream

```http
POST /api/v1/streams/<streamName>/events
--
HEADERS:
	Accept: application/json; charset=utf-8
	Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
	Authorization: Basic <base64>
	X-Producer-ID: <producerID>
--
BODY:
{
	"event": {
		"name" : "OrderPlaced",
		"version" : 1
	},
	"system" : {
		"id" : "alv123",
		"name" :"codello alvine",
		"time": "2017-09-06 13:58:12",
		"timezone" : "Europe/Berlin"		
	},	
	"trigger" : {
		"type": "system",
		"name": "/path/to/script.php"
	},
	"payload" : {} 
}
```

**Possible responses:**

All responses should send the header `Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8`.

### Authorisation

* Create new read/write route and corresponding request handler.
* Implement the PreAuthenticatesToken interface in the request handler
* Now the route can be called with valid credentials (basic auth) only. Otherwise the unauthorized response will be returned. 
* In case you don't want the route to be secured, just create request handler without implementing the PreAuthenticatesToken interface

## Local development

### Bring up the environment

```bash
docker-composer up -d
```

This will automatically:

* Build all necessary docker images for `python` and `postgres`

### Install dependencies

```bash
docker-compose run --rm backend pipenv install -d
```

### Run tests

```bash
docker-compose run --rm backend pipenv run python -m unittest discover tests/unit/ -v
``` 

This will execute all unit tests.

### Using Makefile
Alternatively the Makefile could be used for executing some tasks locally.
Type "make" or "make help" in the root directory, this will display all available make tasks.
There is no guarantee this would work on WinOS.
So, probably you need to install some tool to be able to run the tasks on WinOS.

```bash
make help
```
